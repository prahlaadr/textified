QUICKSTART: Running Textified Locally
=====================================

This guide shows how to quickly kill any existing servers on ports 3000 or 8888, start the Textified app, and access it in your browser.

---

**1. Kill Any Existing Servers on Ports 3000 or 8888**

Paste these commands in your terminal:

lsof -ti :3000 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null
lsof -ti :8888 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null

---

**2. Start Textified (from the project root)**

cd /Users/prahlaad/Desktop/Projects/textified
npm run dev

This will start both the backend (Express, port 8888) and frontend (React, port 3000) using `concurrently`.

---

**3. Open the App in Your Browser**

Go to:
http://localhost:3000

Log in with Spotify when prompted and begin using the app!

---

**IMPORTANT: .env File Required**

Make sure you have a valid `.env` file in `/Users/prahlaad/Desktop/Projects/textified/server` with your Spotify credentials. The app will not work without it.

See the README.md for details on the required environment variables and setup.
